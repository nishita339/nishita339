# Hi, I’m Nishita Singh
Aspiring AI/ML engineer and MERN stack developer. I build end‑to‑end machine learning systems and production‑ready web applications—focusing on reproducible experiments, low‑latency inference, and clean, well‑documented code.

TL;DR: I train and optimize ML models, containerize them (FastAPI/Docker), and connect them to MERN frontends for demos and deployments.

## Selected projects
- Smart‑Face2Avatar — PyTorch, TorchScript, FastAPI, Docker · p95 latency 120 ms ·
- Robust Fake‑News Classifier — DeBERTa, SHAP, reproducible experiments · 
- MLOps Pipeline — Airflow, MLflow, automated retrain + drift detection · 

---

## Core skills
- AI / Machine Learning: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face (Transformers), NLP, Computer Vision  
- Model optimization & deployment: TorchScript, ONNX, quantization, FastAPI, TorchServe  
- MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, REST APIs  
- MLOps & DevOps: Docker, MLflow, Airflow, GitHub Actions, basic Kubernetes  
- Data & tooling: Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Redis, Git, Linux

---

## Current focus
- Advanced deep learning (transfer learning, model optimization)  
- Productionizing ML: monitoring, CI/CD and model registries  
- Scalable MERN backends and deployable demos

---

## Looking to collaborate on
Open to internships, research projects, and practical ML + MERN implementations — especially projects that involve deploying models to production and building user-facing interfaces.

# Hi, I’m Nishita Singh
I am an aspiring AI/ML engineer and a proficient MERN stack developer. I build end-to-end machine learning systems and production-ready web applications, focusing on reproducible experiments, optimized inference, and clean, well-documented code. I am open to research internships and entry-level engineering roles.

## About me
I apply machine learning to practical problems and productionize models as low-latency services. I also develop full-stack web applications using the MERN stack, connecting model backends to responsive frontends and reliable APIs.

## Core skills
- AI / Machine Learning: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face (Transformers), NLP, Computer Vision  
- Model optimization & deployment: TorchScript, ONNX, quantization, FastAPI, TorchServe  
- MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, REST APIs  
- MLOps & DevOps: Docker, MLflow, Airflow, GitHub Actions, basic Kubernetes  
- Data & tooling: Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Redis, Git, Linux

## Currently learning
- Advanced deep learning techniques and transfer learning strategies  
- Robust model monitoring and automated retraining pipelines  
- Scalable deployments with Kubernetes and production-grade observability

## Selected projects
- Smart-Face2Avatar — End-to-end image stylization: PyTorch training, TorchScript optimization, FastAPI + Docker deployment.
- Robust Fake-News Classifier — Transformer-based classifier with SHAP explanations and reproducible experiments.
- MLOps Pipeline — Automated training, model registry (MLflow), and drift detection with Airflow. 
- Task Microservices — MERN microservices example with Docker and CI/CD. 
- Portfolio Website — Personal site showcasing projects, demos, and contact information. 


## Looking to collaborate on
Open to internships, research projects, and practical ML + MERN implementations — especially projects that involve deploying models to production and building user-facing interfaces.
